# 🌐 AleksVision: A Platform for Digital Trust and Ethical Collaboration

**AleksVision** is an independent, transparent platform that empowers anyone  
to submit legal requests, receive support, and co-create meaningful change.  
No registration. No ads. No manipulation.

## 🛡️ AlekS-Initium-UA Platform

### 🎯 Mission  
To build an autonomous, ideologically clear infrastructure for legal action,  
rooted in dignity, transparency, and a shared ethical direction —  
without dependence on state legitimization.

### 🔑 Philosophy  
> Code can be a tool of resistance — if built with purpose, not convenience.

which prohibits use in contexts that violate principles of dignity, transparency, and nonviolence.  
This is not just a legal document — it is a declaration of intent: the platform serves the common good, not private interests.
