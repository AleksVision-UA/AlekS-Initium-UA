## 🧭 For Future Maintainers

This platform was created with a clear ethical foundation: transparency, independence, and legal autonomy.  
Its modular architecture and open documentation are designed to support adaptation, expansion, and responsible stewardship.

If you choose to maintain, extend, or acquire AlekS-Initium-UA, please consider:

- **Preserving its core principles** — as outlined in `initium_manifest.uk.json`
- **Respecting its open-source spirit** — collaborative, auditable, and inclusive
- **Adapting language and structure** only when necessary and with clarity
- **Using English as the default global language**, unless regional needs require otherwise

This is not just a repository — it’s a seed for ethical systems.  
Its future depends on those who dare to build with integrity.
