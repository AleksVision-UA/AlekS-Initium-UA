## ⚖️ Ethical and Legal Foundation

All components of the platform — from code to documentation — are distributed under the [ethically-oriented AlekS-Ethical-License v1.0](LICENSE.md), which prohibits use in contexts that violate principles of dignity, transparency, and nonviolence.  
This is not just a legal document — it’s a declaration of intent: the platform serves the common good, not private interests.
